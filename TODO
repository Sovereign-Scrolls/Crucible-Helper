-= UI improvements =-
For build total, affinity, etc in the first part of the character screen. We should center the box with the title words and the (i) should be use to center. I think. I'll ask Becky
Need a build like interface for Affinity Points
Skill without verbal should not have a verbal tab

-= Features =-
Add arrows on ether side of hit point adjustment
Skill uses need to be remembered
   - Allow skills uses to be cleared based on the time they should renew. Have a profile override.
Remember user choice for skills sorting. - I think this is working, but not remembered between sessions. Need to test
Have a rules lookup section to be able to look up any rule
If the character has unspent build or affinty points, have a button at the top appear to allow character improvements.
Add affinity point cost to the affinty detail modal
For verkin, maybe have on the character screen whatever race they claim to be. If it's clicked 3 times, it will display the correct name.


-= Bugs =-
Affinity points are not calulating correctly.
Cost tab is not displaying the correct cost.
Passive and at will skills should not show a useage.
